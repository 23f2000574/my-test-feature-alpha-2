# Simple Interaction Button Demo

## Overview
This project provides a minimal demonstration of client-side JavaScript interaction. The goal is to present a webpage featuring a single interactive button that modifies its own content upon being pressed, illustrating basic DOM manipulation capabilities.

## Setup
This application is purely front-end and requires no server environment or external dependencies.

1. **Cloning (If Applicable):** If hosted in a repository, clone the project files.
2. **Execution:** Open the `index.html` file directly using any standard modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

*For deployment, ensure an MIT license is present in the repository root and utilize services like GitHub Pages, pointing the serving path to the root directory.*

## Usage
The application features straightforward interaction:

1. **Initial State:** The button displays the default text, "Click Me".
2. **Interaction:** Click the button once.
3. **Result:** The button's text immediately changes to "Clicked!", confirming the action has been processed by the JavaScript handler.
